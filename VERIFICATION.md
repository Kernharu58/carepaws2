# CarePaws Merge Verification

This archive is the merged CarePaws source assembled from the three supplied versions plus the previously merged candidate.

## Merge decisions

- Version B / the previously merged candidate is the primary base because it contained the strongest functional-fix set.
- Version C's Babybook ownership/CRUD tests and Babybook-related UI changes were retained where they improved the merged implementation.
- The stronger merged application controller was preserved rather than replacing it with Version C's older controller.
- The stronger Babybook route was preserved, including pet-ownership authorization and Mongoose update validation.
- A unique partial MongoDB index prevents more than one pending/approved application from controlling a pet at once.

## Additional repairs in this final pass

- Prevented an approved application from being reopened to `pending` or changed to `rejected`.
- Prevented Babybook entry updates from changing the entry's `pet` relationship.
- Babybook pet access now verifies that the target pet exists before returning an empty result to staff.
- Added regression coverage for approved-application reopening and Babybook pet reassignment.

## Verification performed in the build environment

- All backend JavaScript source and test files passed `node --check` syntax validation.
- Adoption and Babybook integration tests from the supplied fixes were present and retained.
- Frontend/backend route wiring for `/api/applications` and `/api/baby-book` was inspected against the mounted Express routes.

## Runtime limitation

A full Jest/Expo/Vite runtime test could not be executed in this environment because dependency installation could not complete before the execution limit and the environment did not have the required frontend/backend dependency trees preinstalled. No runtime success is claimed solely from static checks.
